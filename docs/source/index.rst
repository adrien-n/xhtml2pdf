xhtml2pdf documentation
=======================

**xhtml2pdf** is a HTML to PDF converter using Python, the ReportLab Toolkit, html5lib and pypdf. It supports HTML5 and CSS 2.1 (and some of CSS 3). It is completely written in pure Python, so it is platform independent.

The main benefit of this tool is that a user with web skills like HTML and CSS is able to generate PDF templates very quickly without learning new technologies.

The **Python module** can be used in any Python environment, including Django.
The **Command line tool** is a stand-alone program that can be executed from the command line.
